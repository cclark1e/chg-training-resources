# Overview of the tutorials

Welcome!  This folder contains course materials (practicals, notes and datasets) that were developed for the taught
statistics component of the [Genomic Medicine and Statistics](https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/study/gms) course at the
Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford.  The content is a mixture of training on bioinformatics,
computational and statistical genomics.
