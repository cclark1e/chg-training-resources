# Population structure and admixture

**Authors**: Yang Luo and Jason Torres

This course will cover quantitative topics in human population genetics and application to medical genetics, particularly within admixed populations. The topics covered include an introduction of the 1000 Genomes Project, basic concept of population genetics (e.g. Fst, PCA), model-based clustering (ADMIXTURE/STRUCTURE), local ancestry inference (RFMix), methods for detecting natural selection, and genetic studies in admixed population. This course will emphasis hands-on analysis of large empirical dataset. 

To get started, go and [do some setup](./getting_setup.md).
