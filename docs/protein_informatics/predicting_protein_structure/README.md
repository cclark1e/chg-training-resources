# Structural prediction tutorial

**Contributors**: Charlie J. Clark

Welcome to the structural prediction tutorial, where we will go over the why and how of predicting the structure of proteins (and other biomolecules) with AlphaFold 3.

We will start off by preparing biomolecule sequences into input files for AlphaFold 3, predict their structure, and then explore the results using PyMOL.

When you're ready, head to the [Introduction](Introduction.md).
