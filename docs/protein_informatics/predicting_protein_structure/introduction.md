# Introduction

In this practical, we will explore protein structure prediction, which is often crucial for understanding how a protein functions.
We will use the AlphaFold 3 webapp, and you will need access to Python to construct input files. If you haven't set up your environment, visit 
the [prerequisites section](/prerequisites) for a guide.

### Getting Set Up

To start, you need:

- Access to Python
- Basic knowledge of biology and proteins

### What is Structural Prediction?

Protein structure prediction determines the 3D structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence. The function of a protein
is closely linked to its shape, or conformation, so understanding the structure provides insights into how proteins perform various functions
such as catalysing reactions or interacting with binding partners. Understanding protein structure is also an important aspect of
drug discovery and development.

### Why Predict Protein Structure?

Protein structure prediction has several applications:

- **Drug Design**: Understanding protein conformation helps in designing drugs that interact target proteins.
- **Understanding Diseases**: Misfolded proteins are linked to diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Predicting structures helps understand how these misfolding events occur.
- **Pathogen Research**: Predicting the structure of viral or bacterial proteins can help us to understand how pathogens harm humans and identify their vulnerabilities, aiding in the development of treatments and vaccines.
- **Genetic Disorders**: Mutations affecting protein structure can lead to genetic diseases. Predicting how these mutations alter structure helps in understanding disease mechanisms and developing therapies.

### About AlphaFold 3

AlphaFold is an AI system developed by DeepMind that predicts the 3D structure of proteins based on their amino acid sequences.
AlphaFold 3 is not limited to predicting only protein structure, though. 
At the time of writing, AlphaFold 3 can predict the structure of proteins, nucleic acids, and ligands.
