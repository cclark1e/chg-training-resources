# Challenge questions

The SNP [rs601338](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs601338) controls ’secretor status’ (i.e. whether A/B
antigens are secreted into bodily fluids) Individuals with GG or GA genotypes at this SNP are secretors, and
individuals with homozygous AA genotypes are non-secretors - as described in [this paper based on the ALSPAC
cohort](10.12688/wellcomeopenres.14636.2).

:::tip Can you solve?

Use the [UCSC genome browser](https://genome.ucsc.edu) and [Ensembl](http://www.ensembl.org/index.html), and your gene
annotation file, to solve:

* Use the genome browser to find out where rs601338 in the gene.  (NB. use GRCh38 assembly coordinates for this.)

* Does this agree with the gene annotation file?  Which exon of *FUT2* is the SNP in?

* Using the genome browser, can you figure out **what amino acid change rs601338 makes to the encoded protein?**

* Using the Ensembl site, can you find an individual from the 1000 Genomes Project data with the secretor genotype?  And an individual with
non-secretor genotype?
