# Summary

In this tutorial we've covered some basic ways of working with R, including

- carrying out basic computations
- working with 'vectors', i.e., several values at once
- finding documentation help and solve errors
- how to create and manipulate variables
- how to load libraries and packages
- ways of working with data and making simple plots

Of course this wasn't a complete summary, and there is lots more to learn, but we hope this was a useful introduction.
