# Appendix: a list of Ensembl GFF files.

A list of gff files from ensembl can be found in [`solutions/ensembl_gff_listing.txt`](solutions/ensembl_gff_listing.txt).

If you look [on ensembl](http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/current_gff3/) you will find lots of these gff files - I have selected some as
follows:

* if a species has a file of the form `[species].[version].chr.gff3.gz` then I used that.  
* otherwise, I used one of the form `[species].[version].gff3.gz`.

If you want to get an up-to-date list or see a quick way to download the files, try [using lftp](/bioinformatics/tips_and_tricks/recursive_ftp.md).
